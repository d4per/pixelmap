**Swarm Intelligence for Dense Image Correspondence**

The **PIXELMAP** framework leverages **swarm intelligence** and **iterative refinement strategies** to establish **dense, robust, and accurate image correspondences**. By conceptualizing each grid cell in an **Affine Correspondence Grid (AC-Grid)** as an autonomous "agent," PIXELMAP iteratively refines local affine transformations and ensures global geometric consistency.

This approach is highly effective for tasks such as:
- **3D Reconstruction**
- **Stereo Matching**
- **Image Stitching**
- **Optical Flow**

## üìö **Overview**
PIXELMAP introduces a novel approach by combining **Correspondence Mapping (CM)** and **Iterative Refinement (IR)**:

- **Correspondence Mapping (CM):** Swarm-inspired dynamics enable local optimizations through agent-based collaboration.
- **Iterative Refinement (IR):** Ensures global consistency by smoothing and refining affine transformations across neighboring grid cells.
- **Affine Correspondence Grid (AC-Grid):** A structured grid representation that balances local adaptability with global coherence.

This synergy results in accurate pixel-to-pixel mappings, even in challenging conditions such as occlusions, geometric distortions, and varying lighting.
